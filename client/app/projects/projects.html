<!-- general HTML template for all groups -->
<!--
  Main idea of the project view is to resemble a pinboard that would be used to
  create a project. This pinboard includes general tasks that are essential to the project,
  such as 'create db that responds to requests from the client'. Then, a project member
  is able to further break down the general tasks by category, such as 'frontend' and 'backend'.

  Tasks can be given further detail, including:
    -Priority

  Includes:

  1. Name of project
  2. Input field to add general tasks to project pinboard
    a. same addTask function used here as with general tasks, however
      group ID included in body of POST -OR- in the URI
  3. Feature to add new member to project
    a. input field that searches by username
      - sends a GET request to server with input value
  4. Input field to add new category to pinboard (not priority) -->
