# Fridge — Your Everyday Task Manager #

From families to startups, Fridge is the simplest way to assign and organize group tasks.

No more haphazard sticky notes scattered across the refrigerator door. Remind the kids to take out the trash, remind the neighbor to walk the dog, and remind your co-worker to pick up lunch, all from one app. Introducing Fridge — a group task manager redesigned for the everyday user. 

Existing task managers are not designed for everyday use. They often include features that might be necessary for the power user, but make for an unwieldy experience for the typical one. 

Fridge removes the frills of existing task managers to create a product that helps anyone from of a mother assigning chores to a CEO managing product features across teams. Create groups, assign tasks, and monitor completion, all from one elegant interface.

With Fridge, we included only the integral features of task management — creating groups, assigning tasks, and monitoring task completion.  Create a ‘Family’ group to assign chores to your children, a ‘Company’ group to assign clients to your employees, and a ‘Softball’ group to keep track of who’s bringing snacks for the next game. Manage all of these different groups from one intuitive app. Become more organized and maximize your productivity today.

“Fridge was incredibly fun to build. We interviewed everyone from Fortune 500 CEOs to my ten-year-old niece and only included features that both of these groups would use. We’re really excited to see how this can improve productivity for the everyday user”
									-Konstantin Zamaraev
									Product Manager, Fridge

“Fridge allows me to open one app and easily monitor both my employees’ progress on their presentation next week and my children’s progress on their weekly chores. It’s sleek enough for corporate use but simple enough for my five-year-old daughter.”
									-Ridwan Kazi
									Owner, SandwichMart

We’ll be rolling out more features in the next few weeks, including Facebook integration, text notifications, and a mobile app for iOS and Android. Stay tuned!
