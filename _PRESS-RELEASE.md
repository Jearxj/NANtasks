There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# Fridge — Your Everyday Task Manager #

From families to startups, Fridge is the simplest way to assign and organize group tasks. 

-------
JULY 18, 2016

No more haphazard sticky notes scattered across the refrigerator door. Remind the kids to take out the trash, remind the neighbor to walk the dog, and remind your co-worker to pick up lunch, all from one app. Introducing Fridge — a group task manager redesigned for the everyday user. 

Existing task managers are not designed for everyday use. They often include features that might be necessary for the power user, but make for an unwieldy experience for the typical one. 

Fridge removes the frills of existing task managers to create a product that helps anyone from of a mother assigning chores to a CEO managing product features across teams. Create groups, assign tasks, and monitor completion, all from one elegant interface.

With Fridge, we included only the integral features of task management — creating groups, assigning tasks, and monitoring task completion.  Create a ‘Family’ group to assign chores to your children, a ‘Company’ group to assign clients to your employees, and a ‘Softball’ group to keep track of who’s bringing snacks for the next game. Manage all of these different groups from one intuitive app. Become more organized and maximize your productivity today.

“Fridge was incredibly fun to build. We interviewed everyone from Fortune 500 CEOs to my ten-year-old niece and only included features that both of these groups would use. We’re really excited to see how this can improve productivity for the everyday user”
									-Konstantin Zamaraev
									Product Manager, Fridge

“Fridge allows me to open one app and easily monitor both my employees’ progress on their presentation next week and my children’s progress on their weekly chores. It’s sleek enough for corporate use but simple enough for my five-year-old daughter.”
									-Ridwan Kazi
									Owner, SandwichMart

We’ll be rolling out more features in the next few weeks, including Facebook integration, text notifications, and a mobile app for iOS and Android. Stay tuned!
